# VisualizeCities
A project to visualize cities with the largest populations on a world map. Given a text file with a list of cities and their attributes 
(such as population, latitude/longitude), the program will parse the file and create 3 ordered lists of cities: one list in alphabetical order,
one in order of population from largest to smallest, and one in order of latitude from South to North. The visualization aspect will animate on 
a world map the locations of the cities with the 50 largest populations.
